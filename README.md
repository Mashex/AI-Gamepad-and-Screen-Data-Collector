# AI Gamepad and Screen Data Collector

## Summary
 This repository aims to assist in the data collection process for AI applications and research. Collecting Data is a very tedious process, and this script helps to simultaneously collect the screen capture data through the D3DShot Library, and the controller inputs through the inputs library. 
 The data is automatically bundled and stored in an easily accesible format. 
 
 With a target resolution width of 224, the data collector captures the frames and controller inputs at a staggering 120 FPS !
